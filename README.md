# AnomalyDetection-AdditiveManufacturing
Developing ML algorithm for anomaly detection for PBF Additive Manufacturing as final year individual project

# Files location and accesing them (for Dmitry Isakov)
In the 'main' branch you can find the three main codes that are useful. These are subject to change but they should show what I have basically ended up doing and choosing. They are the "final" version of the code so have in mind that a lot more research and other attempts were done to end up with a usable code. The three files are: 
- HowtoReadandCutvideo: This is the file that I use to manipulate (change frame rate, crop, shorten...) the large 55GB and 75GB videos. 
- IdentifyingFrames: This file shows the code for selecting the desired frames to access, crop and save on my computer, from which I obtained the images for the different samples. 
- ClassificationBagofWords: This file is the code for classification of the 3 different samples using a BagofWords (explained briefly on Mahara).
